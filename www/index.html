                <h3>Garden Waterer</h3>
                <p>One of my passions is gardening, and I have always been interested in finding ways to optimize my watering habits to ensure that my plants receive the optimal amount of moisture. To this end, I have been working on a project to create a device that can monitor soil moisture levels and provide recommendations for watering based on the specific needs of each plant. This device would be built using a microcontroller such as Arduino and would be connected wirelessly to a dashboard created using Python. This dashboard would collect and analyze data from the device, providing real-time insights into soil moisture levels and helping me to make informed decisions about watering. I am excited to see how this project will help me to improve the health and vitality of my garden, and I am looking forward to the opportunity to share my progress with others who share a similar interest in gardening and technology.</p>

                <h3>Image Converter</h3>
                <p>While taking the free version of CS50, I was inspired by a problem set involving photo conversion to build my own tool for converting images between various styles. This tool, which is being refactored in Python from C, will allow users to easily convert images between styles such as Grayscale, Sepia, and Reflect, as well as resize them as needed. To make the tool accessible to a wide range of users, I plan to deploy it using a web-based UI with an Amazon Web Services (AWS) backbone. My goal is to create a user-friendly tool that can help people quickly and easily modify their images to meet their specific needs.</p>
