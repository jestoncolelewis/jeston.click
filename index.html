                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <h3>VERTA Safety Website<br>(in implementation phase)</h3>
                <p>One page website for a client to attract new users to a beta of their upcoming app.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Initial build used a site builder but I transitioned the build to HTML & CSS with skill acquisition.</li>
                    <li>Started hosting on Namecheap using Wordpress then moved over to AWS hosting and address routing</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Garden Waterer<br>(in analysis phase)</h3>
                <p>One of my hobbies is gardening and I wanted to create a device to monitor soil moisture and optimize how much to water based on plant need.</p>

                <h3>VERTA Safety Tracker<br>(in design phase)</h3>
                <p>Goal is to create a tracking device for use in emergency vehicles in coordination with a user facing app for public use.</p>

                <h3>Image Converter<br>(in implementation phase)</h3>
                <p>While taking the free version of CS50, they had a problem set involving photo conversion and it inspired me to build my own. This will deployed using a web based UI with AWS backbone.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Original problem set was built using C</li>
                    <li>Decided to use Python for easier deployment to a web based environment</li>
                    <li>Through a Udemy course, I learned about a variety of helpful libraries for image processing</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Document Converter<br>(in analysis phase)</h3>
                <p>Goal is similar to image converter I built using python. The main difference being a simple to use converter for PDFs and other text based documents.</p>

                <h3>AWS Live Stream Solution<br>(archived)</h3>
                <p>My previous business offered live streaming services using vMix as an encoder. I utilized AWS to distribute the stream to audiences.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Used AWS MediaLive as input from the encoder to create outputs for live distribution</li>
                    <li>Took the inputs from MediaLive and sent it to MediaPackage for delivery to audiences</li>
                    <li>Embedded using a variety of methods including CloudFront</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Argos Productions Website<br>(archived)</h3>
                <p>While operating my previous business, I was responsible for all of the website creation and maintenance.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This site was always built using site builders, primarily Wordpress.</li>
                    <li>I handled design and implementation over multiple years, updating as necessary</li>
                </ul>
